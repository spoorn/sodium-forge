### This is Forge edition of Sodium/Lithium/Phosphor

Sodium is a free and open-source optimization mod for the Minecraft client that improves frame rates, reduces
micro-stutter, and fixes graphical issues in Minecraft. 

:warning: This fork uses outdated dev branch of original repo, though this fork is functional, stuff will be broken. 

This fork includes Lithium, as [original repo](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) says:

* Lithium is a free and open-source Minecraft mod which works to optimize many areas of the game in order to provide
  better overall performance. It works on both the **client and server**, and **doesn't require the mod to be installed
  on both sides**. 
  
This fork includes Phosphor, as [original repo](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric) says:

 * Phosphor is a free and open-source Minecraft mod (under GNU GPLv3) aiming to save your CPU cycles and improve performance by optimizing one of Minecraft's most inefficient areas-- the lighting engine.
   It works on **both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod**
 * The mod is designed to be as minimal as possible in the changes it makes, and as such, does not modify the light model or interfaces of vanilla Minecraft. Because of this, Phosphor should be compatible with many Minecraft mods (so long as they do not make drastic changes to how the lighting engine works.) If you've ran into a compatibility problem, please open an issue!
### Downloads

### Community

of sodium/phosphor/lithium are not support by original authors, if you encounter any issues, check current issues on this repo or 
make a new issue. 

### Building from source

If you're hacking on the code or would like to compile a custom build of Sodium from the latest sources, you'll want
to start here.

#### Prerequisites

You will need to install JDK 8 (or newer, see below) in order to build Sodium. You can either install this through
a package manager such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows or [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) on other
platforms. If you'd prefer to not use a package manager, you can always grab the installers or packages directly from
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

On Windows, the Oracle JDK/JRE builds should be avoided where possible due to their poor quality. Always prefer using
the open-source builds from AdoptOpenJDK when possible.

#### Compiling

Navigate to the directory you've cloned this repository and launch a build with Gradle using `gradlew build` (Windows)
or `./gradlew build` (macOS/Linux). If you are not using the Gradle wrapper, simply replace `gradlew` with `gradle`
or the path to it.

The initial setup may take a few minutes. After Gradle has finished building everything, you can find the resulting
artifacts in `build/libs`.

### Tuning for optimal performance

_This section is entirely optional and is only aimed at users who are interested in squeezing out every drop from their
game. Sodium will work without issue in the default configuration of almost all launchers._

Generally speaking, newer versions of Java will provide better performance not only when playing Minecraft, but when
using Sodium as well. The default configuration your game launcher provides will usually be some old version of Java 8
that has been selected to maximize hardware compatibility instead of performance.

For most users, these compatibility issues are not relevant, and it should be relatively easy to upgrade the game's Java
runtime and apply the required patches. For more information on upgrading and tuning the Java runtime, see the
guide [here](https://gist.github.com/jellysquid3/8a7b21e57f47f5711eb5697e282e502e).
